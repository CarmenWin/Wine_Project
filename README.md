# Wine_Project
This project analyses red and white wine data from Portugal.The dataset used can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. I was starting this project with a very basic EDA of the two wine types (red and white) and continued on to use different ML models to predict wine type and wine quality.
